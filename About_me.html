    <h1>Below are pics of me on the ocean and my beautiful daughter Winnie. <br> In my picture, I'm stearing a sale boat around the Block Island windmills. That was fun! <br> Below that, is a picture of my daughter Winnie. She just turned 1 year old last month. <br> She is just starting to walk, and yesterday, me and my Fiancee took her to the beach for the first time.</h1>
